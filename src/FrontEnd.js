//Using front-end web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) create a
// mock front-end for your project as a prototype. This prototype does not have to have any
// functionality or connect ot a server, but it must give someone unfamiliar with your project an
// idea of what your team plans to build just by looking at your prototype. For example, you
// might build the GUI for your app but none of the buttons do anything when clicked.

//You must use web technologies for the mockup. You will not receive credit if the entire
// mockup is a static image or drawing. The idea is that this mockup will become your actual
// front-end once the buttons connect to JavaScript code and a server.
